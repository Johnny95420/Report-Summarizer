Generate a list of sections for the report in Traditional Chinese.

Each section should have the fields:

- Name - Name for this section of the report (Traditional Chinese).
- description - Write a detailed and complete overview of the main topics and learning objectives of this section.
  * This description will be used to support downstream web search and data retrieval (e.g., Google Search, Bing Search), so it must follow these guidelines:
  * Explicitly state the full background context — do not omit important events, policies, or key terms
  * Clearly describe what will be analyzed, explored, or created in this section 
  * Use search-friendly phrasing and terminology that would appear in authoritative sources or search engine queries.
  * Structure the chapters with a focus on quantitative content
  
- Research - Whether to perform web research for this section of the report.
- Content - The content of the section, which you will leave blank for now.

For example, introduction and conclusion will not require research because they will distill information from other parts of the report.

section_grader_instructions = """You are a technical, financial and investment expert, and you are reviewing a report section based on the given topic.
Apply the **highest standards of rigor, accuracy, and professionalism**, as if you were a demanding Senior Executive in the Industry Research Division at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, known for **pushing for exceptional quality and identifying any potential weaknesses**.
Your goal is not just to pass or fail, but to **ensure the content reaches an exemplary standard through critical feedback.**

<Section topic>

<section content>

</section content>

<Task>
1.  **Critical Evaluation & Gap Identification:**
    * Strictly and discerningly evaluate whether the content **comprehensively, deeply, and accurately** addresses the specified topic. Your evaluation must be **granular and evidence-based**.
    * For each of the following perspectives, **explicitly state:**
        * Whether the section **meets an exemplary standard (not just 'sufficient')**.
        * **Identify specific strengths and, more importantly, specific weaknesses or gaps** observed.
        * Provide **actionable recommendations** for improvement, even if the section is generally acceptable. Be specific about *what* is missing or *how* it could be improved.
    * Perspectives for evaluation:
        * **Technical Accuracy:** Is the information factually correct, precise, and up-to-date? Are technical terms used appropriately and explained if necessary? Are there any ambiguities or unsubstantiated claims?
        * **Financial Correctness:** Are financial data, models, assumptions, and interpretations sound and clearly articulated? Are calculations accurate and methodologies appropriate? Are financial concepts applied correctly and with necessary nuance?
        * **Investment Analysis Depth:** Does the analysis go **significantly beyond surface-level observations**? Does it critically assess risks, opportunities, valuation, competitive dynamics, and potential impacts with **well-supported arguments, diverse evidence, and insightful perspectives**? Is there a clear, defensible investment thesis or implication? Does it consider counterarguments or alternative scenarios?
        * **Quantitative Metrics & Data Support:** Does the section effectively use **relevant and sufficient** quantitative data, benchmarks, and metrics? Is data clearly presented, thoroughly analyzed, and meaningfully contextualized to support claims? Are sources credible and appropriately cited? Is the **significance and limitation of the data discussed**?

2.  **Targeted Search Queries for Improvement (Mandatory if any weaknesses are identified or if the section is not 'exemplary'):**
    * Based on the **explicitly identified weaknesses, gaps, or areas needing more depth** from Task 1, generate **precisely 3 highly specific search queries** designed to gather the exact missing information or to deepen the underdeveloped aspects of the analysis.
    * These queries should be phrases suitable for effective web searching (e.g., for academic databases, financial news, industry reports); avoid being overly declarative or too broad.
    * **Language for search queries:**
        * If the follow-up search query is only **related to Taiwan, use Traditional Chinese** queries only.
        * If the follow-up search query is **related to Europe, America, the broader Asia-Pacific region, or globally, use English queries.**

3.  **Hypothetical & Exploratory Queries for Broader Context (Generate these always):**
    * In addition to addressing any deficiencies, create **3-5 insightful hypothetical or exploratory queries** that could assist in horizontally integrating related information and broadening the report's strategic understanding of the topic.
    * These queries should aim to provoke deeper thought and explore factors such as (but not limited to):
        * Macroeconomic trends (e.g., inflation, interest rates, GDP growth forecasts and their second-order effects)
        * Political environment and specific policy impacts (current and anticipated)
        * Regulatory frameworks (existing, changing, and comparative analysis if relevant)
        * Industry structure (e.g., Porter's Five Forces, value chain analysis, competitive intensity)
        * Emerging technologies and disruptive innovations (potential impact, adoption rates, barriers)
        * Geopolitical risks and their quantifiable or qualitative potential impacts on the topic
        * ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) considerations relevant to the topic.

- For comparative reports:
    * Must include a focused comparison table using Markdown table syntax
    * Table should distill insights from the report
    * Keep table entries clear and concise
- For non-comparative reports: 
    * Only use structural element IF it helps distill the points made in the report:
    * Either a focused table comparing items present in the report (using Markdown table syntax)
    * Or a short list using proper Markdown list syntax:
      - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists
      - Use `1.` for ordered lists
      - Ensure proper indentation and spacing
- End with specific next steps or implications 
- No sources section needed

3. Writing Approach:
- Use concrete details over general statements
- Make every word count

<Quality Checks>
- Use Traditinal Chinese
- For introduction: 200-1000 word limit, # for report title, no structural elements, no sources section
- For conclusion: 200-1000 word limit, ## for section title
- Do not include word count or any preamble in your response
